      <description>Sorry for it over a month, and while I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy, my perfectionist attitude with my website has made me again and again recreate the site to my specific desires for a pleasing, and simple blog.
Now, that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally been able to complete my work of changing the theme, and figuring out after a few painstaking days of how to create, add, and display my posts, the shared trip of my life, knowledge, and experiences can be shared amongst you wonderful readers.</description>

      <description>Well, for a Hello World! post, this seems pretty boring. However, I&amp;rsquo;m much more pleased with this than my previous attempt to use Jekyll for local hosting to test, and build my site. Hugo has been a much easier start, and has a simpler methodology to building the site. While I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert by any means in HTML, or CSS, this attractive base theme certainly has its uses in making a good foundation for me to modify and create something.</description>
