      <description>Well, for a Hello World! post, this seems pretty boring. However, I&amp;rsquo;m much more pleased with this than my previous attempt to use Jekyll for local hosting to test, and build my site. Hugo has been a much easier start, and has a simpler methodology to building the site. While I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert by any means in HTML, or CSS, this attractive base theme certainly has its uses in making a good foundation for me to modify and create something.</description>
