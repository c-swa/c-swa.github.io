                <h2>Site Redesign</h2>
                <h4>March 13, 2021</h4>
                <p>
                    As some people may have noticed, especially those who've visited my site before, that there has been a change 
                    in the design of the site. Originally, I had used a Jekyll static site generator. The second iteration of my site 
                    used a GoHugo static site generator. And this time, I have writted the full HTML and CSS from scratch myself. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The change this time is aimed at having a focus on building the full, proper, site to represent my goals of having 
                    an entirely independent product. One that I wholly created myself. And while the tools that I have used before were immensely 
                    helpful in design, they limited what I could do to only the options available via the themes. 
                    <br/>
                    The shift towards writing each post from scratch in HTML enables me to have fine tuned control over the site and posts. I can 
                    add whatever photos that I take, software that I build, and thoughts that I have. These can all accurately be created and 
                    represented by whichever design and layout that I can build myself. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, with this customized layout, it will limit what I can do in set amounts of time. Thus, posting every day is 
                    highly unlikely. But it does enable me to, in the future, setup a method of automated updates. Being the captain of my 
                    own product, I have the full ability to push these changes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Planning from here on out, I will be updating this site with progess on my open source activities. There will also be a portion, under 
                    the <b>archive</b> section that will contain my photography and image collection. A good way to conciously be consistent and concurrent with my site, 
                    would be to do a weekly post of an image that I had taken that week. Whether that image be taken with a smartphone, or a DLSR is up in the air, and can be decided 
                    at a later date. 
                    <br/>
                    <br>
                    The <b>?</b> section will contain miscellaneous projects that I think would be beneficial for other people to download or run on their
                    web browser. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I want to keep this project entirely voluntary, and within the realm of ability for time constraints. So I don't think it to be necessary to guarantee a 
                    post every week. Ideally, a post will be drafted and worked on throughout a week, then uploaded at the end of the week.
