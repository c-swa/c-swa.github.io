Well, for a Hello World! post, this seems pretty boring. However, I'm much more pleased with this than my
previous attempt to use Jekyll for local hosting to test, and build my site. Hugo has been a much easier start, and has
a simpler methodology to building the site. While I'm not an expert by any means in HTML, or CSS, this attractive base theme
certainly has its uses in making a good foundation for me to modify and create something.
