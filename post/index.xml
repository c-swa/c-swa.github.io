      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve been absent from updating my website as of late. The biggest issue concerning this was that I had upgraded from a 2011 MacBook Pro, to a 2015 MacBook Pro. Sidenote: I&amp;rsquo;d be willing to debate this, but the 2015 MacBook Pro was the last &amp;ldquo;great&amp;rdquo; MacBook Whilst doing this, I ended up committing the grave sin that all people do at some point or another- I never backed up the GoHugo site-generator source code.</description>

      <description>Sorry for it over a month, and while I’ve been busy, my perfectionist attitude with my website has made me again and again recreate the site to my specific desires for a pleasing, and simple blog.
Now, that I’ve finally been able to complete my work of changing the theme, and figuring out after a few painstaking days of how to create, add, and display my posts, the shared trip of my life, knowledge, and experiences can be shared amongst you wonderful readers.</description>

      <description>Well, for a Hello World! post, this seems pretty boring. However, I’m much more pleased with this than my previous attempt to use Jekyll for local hosting to test, and build my site. Hugo has been a much easier start, and has a simpler methodology to building the site. While I’m not an expert by any means in HTML, or CSS, this attractive base theme certainly has its uses in making a good foundation for me to modify and create something.</description>
