            <p>
                I'm a recent University of Missouri - Kansas City graduate, with a B.S. in Computer Science. 
                A majority of my time is spent working on one of four things:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Vehicular projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Software/Hardware projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Photography escapes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reading.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The list is in no particular order, as it is purely counting four things. 
            </p>

                My photography has been uploaded by myself to Flickr in the past. I do believe I will continue to upload my shots there. However, starting with this site, 
                I will also make those shots, and others available here. While some of my software is open source, and free to use, my photos and collections here are copyrighted. 
                <br><br>
                The images both on Flickr and here are free to download, and in non-commercial purposes, allowed for use without redistribution, free of charge. Any commercial use of 
                my copyrighted content however, is prohibited without prior consent.
