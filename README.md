This repository is the foundation of my website and blog.

Unfortunately, due to my lack of backups on my older laptop, before I sold it, I had not recovered the source code for the 
GoHugo static site generator. Thus, I had to build the site from scratch. Due to the slight changes made to the site, I attempted
to keep everything as original as possible, but the software was not cooperating with me, and has had problems with the home page
not showing the posts properly. Currently it is linking to a ~/post/ directory, where the blog posts are kept, and not pulling the 
posts from the directory to display them on the home page. 

The other big problem is that I don't have a whole lot of time to work on this project every day, so I may end up changing my theme
to suite the newer version of Hugo (0.63). My plans, should I take this route, hope to keep as close to the current theme as possible.

Christopher.
